## About me: :alien:
 
I am a Software Engineer and Software Architect with over 5 years of experience designing, building, and evolving backend systems for complex, high-impact products. I work across the full software lifecycle, from system design and architecture to implementation, observability, and production support.

I specialize in backend engineering and distributed systems, with a strong focus on scalability, reliability, and clean, maintainable architectures. I enjoy tackling technically challenging problems and collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to deliver resilient systems that scale over time.

I hold a degree in Systems Analysis and Development and a postgraduate degree in Software Architecture.

I am deeply passionate about programming and technology, and my purpose is to use my skills to create solutions that positively impact the world.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
  System.out.println("Welcome to my universe!!!");
}
```
